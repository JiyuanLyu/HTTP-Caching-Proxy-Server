Danger Log

02/20: cannot connect the docker, met problem with mount (now solved)
       We firstly start our project and ensure it run it in local

02/23: met Makefile errors when multiple class in including (now solved)
       We rewrite the Makefile and fix the errors

02/23: handle the proxy server policy in proxy.cpp (now solved)
       **External failuresï¼š**
       Our code will send a 502 error code and log it into proxy.log when receiving corrupted responses,
       and send a 400 error code and log it into proxy.log when receives malformed requests.

02/24: fix socket connect problems due to failure case in Server (destructor didn't called)
       This is due to the exit(EXIT_FAILURE) for the socket errors and it didn't close socket_fd properly
       **Exception guarantees: Basic Exception**
       We fix by well handling the exceptions and the errors in Server class instead of exit(EXIT_FAILURE)
       The error in creating, connecting, listening will be written to log file

02/26: rewrite the cache class
       We rewrite the cache class for protocol policy handling 200 and 402 status for cacheable response.

02/28: fix the error for encrypted hostname

02/28: debug for exiting program failure
       **Exception guarantees: **
       We fix by handling the exceptions when cannot get host name in request

02/28: add cache log message when get 200 OK response

02/28: fix the dead lock bug
       we edit the lock for cache class to avoiding conflict locks

02/29: link to the docker and mount the log file
       We well handle the mount with the `/var/log/erss` in the docker container with the `logs`directory under `docker-deploy`

03/01: add response to cache when maxAge is 0 or no Cache, treat as must re-validation when get response from cache

03/01: the performance of opening the post page and the Toranto future page is not stable
       sometimes need long time to load
       These pages could be opened with refreshing (or just wait for the page to come out)
       This might due to the host name is encrypted or lost from the request server site

03/01: The program might be shut down when all the threads are currently in used
